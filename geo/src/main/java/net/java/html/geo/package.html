        HTML Geo API for Java provides <a href="OnLocation.html">annotation based way</a> of
        obtaining geolocation information from a browser or any other 
        device capable of providing it.
        The primary way to use this API is to 
        create a non-private method and annotate it with <a href="OnLocation.html">@OnLocation</a>
        annotation.
