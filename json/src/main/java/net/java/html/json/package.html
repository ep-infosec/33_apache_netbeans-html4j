    This API allows you to write your application logic in Java and 
    present it using modern HTML rendering technologies like 
    <a href="http://knockoutjs.com">Knockout</a>
    and communicate with
    a server via <a href="OnReceive.html">REST</a> or 
    <a href="doc-files/websockets.html">WebSocket</a>s.
    </p>
    <img src="doc-files/html4j.png">
    <p>
    Use <a href="Model.html">@Model</a> annotation to define one or more
    model classes with <a href="Property.html">properties</a>. Don't waste
    time writing setters or getters - they will be generated for you. 
    Just instantiate your classes and use them!
    </p>
    <p>
    The class generator does not stop with getters and setters -- internally
    it generates bindings for various HTML technologies. Just include appropriate
    technology implementation on classpath of your application and your model
    class(es) will automatically be bound to your HTML elements (after calling
    <code>applyBindings()</code> on your model).
    </p>
    <p>
    You don't have to bother with JavaScript. All your application logic is in
    Java. The necessary JavaScript needed for the HTML bindings remains hidden
    as an implementation detail of communication between the generated model
    class(es) and appropriate technology bridge. For example
    the <code>ko4j</code> module:
    </p>
    <pre>
&lt;dependency&gt;
  &lt;groupId&gt;org.netbeans.html&lt;/groupId&gt;
  &lt;artifactId&gt;ko4j&lt;/artifactId&gt;
  &lt;scope&gt;runtime&lt;/scope&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
    </pre>
    <p>
    In case you decide to use <a target="ko" href="http://knockoutjs.com">Knockout</a>
    as your rendering technology, it is recommended to look at its 
    <a target="ko" href="http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/introduction.html">documentation</a>
    (especially its HTML part) as <code>data-bind</code> syntax is exactly
    what one has to use in the HTML file(s). Of course, one does not need
    to bother with the JavaScript part, that is completely hidden in the
    code generated when processing the {@link net.java.html.json.Model}
    annotation.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    The model classes can be used for JSON based server communication. Just
    use <a href="OnReceive.html">@OnReceive</a> annotation to define a communication
    point in the model class. Please note, that the model classes can easily
    be used on server as well - the same code can run
    in your client as well as on your server. Just add following to your <em>pom.xml</em>
    to use your classes generated by <a href="Model.html">@Model</a> annotation
    as <a href="http://jersey.java.net" target="new">Jersey</a> entities:
    </p>
    <pre>
&lt;dependency&gt;
  &lt;groupId&gt;org.glassfish.jersey.media&lt;/groupId&gt;
  &lt;artifactId&gt;html-json&lt;/artifactId&gt;
  &lt;version&gt;2.6&lt;/version&gt;
  &lt;scope&gt;runtime&lt;/scope&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
    </pre>
    <p>
    Behavior of model classes can be enriched by using 
    <a href="ComputedProperty.html">@ComputedProperty</a> annotation (to
    define <em>derived</em> properties) and by 
    <a href="Function.html">@Function</a> annotation to define handlers
    to be invoked from the HTML elements.
    </p>
